# Get-AppThrottlingData

## SYNOPSIS
Enriches application data with throttling statistics from Azure Log Analytics.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-AppThrottlingData [-AppData] <Array> [-WorkspaceId] <String> [[-Days] <Int32>]
 [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This function queries Azure Log Analytics to retrieve Microsoft Graph API throttling statistics
for each application over a specified time period.
It adds comprehensive throttling metrics as
a new property to each application object, enabling analysis of API rate limiting impacts.

The function processes all applications efficiently by:
1.
Fetching all throttling statistics in a single batch query
2.
Creating an indexed lookup table for fast matching (O(1) complexity)
3.
Matching applications to their statistics using ServicePrincipalId
4.
Adding zeroed statistics for applications without activity
5.
Providing progress feedback during processing

Throttling metrics include:
- **Request Counts**: Total requests, successful requests, errors by type
- **Rate Calculations**: Throttle rate, error rate, success rate (percentages)
- **Severity Classification**: Automatic 0-4 scale based on throttle rate
- **Status Descriptions**: Human-readable severity labels (Normal, Warning, Critical, etc.)
- **Time Range**: First and last occurrence timestamps for analyzed period

Severity Classification:
- **0 (Normal)**: No throttling detected or \< 1% throttle rate
- **1 (Minimal)**: 1-5% throttle rate - occasional throttling
- **2 (Low)**: 5-10% throttle rate - regular throttling, should be monitored
- **3 (Warning)**: 10-25% throttle rate - significant throttling, optimization recommended
- **4 (Critical)**: \> 25% throttle rate - severe throttling, immediate action required

This data is critical for:
- Identifying applications experiencing API rate limiting issues
- Understanding performance impact on users
- Prioritizing optimization efforts
- Capacity planning for Graph API usage
- Troubleshooting application performance problems
- Monitoring application health over time

Use Cases:
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track API throttling trends across applications
- **Incident Investigation**: Identify throttled apps during performance issues
- **Optimization Planning**: Prioritize which apps need retry logic/batching
- **Health Dashboards**: Create executive reports on API health
- **SLA Monitoring**: Ensure applications meet performance requirements
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand API consumption patterns

## EXAMPLES

## NOTES
Prerequisites:
- Azure Log Analytics workspace with MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs table enabled
- Microsoft Graph diagnostic settings configured to send logs to workspace
- Appropriate permissions to query Log Analytics via Invoke-EntraRequest
- Get-AppThrottlingStat function must be available (private function dependency)
- PowerShell 5.1 or later

Log Analytics Configuration:
To enable Microsoft Graph activity logging:
1.
Navigate to Azure AD \> Diagnostic settings
2.
Add diagnostic setting
3.
Select "MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs" log category
4.
Send to Log Analytics workspace
5.
Wait 10-15 minutes for initial data to appear

Performance Characteristics:
- **Bulk Query Approach**: Single Log Analytics query for all applications
- **Lookup Table**: O(1) complexity for matching applications to statistics
- **Memory Efficient**: Indexed lookup minimizes memory overhead
- **Processing Time**: ~5-30 seconds for typical tenants (100-1000 apps)
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of applications efficiently

Matching Logic:
- Uses ServicePrincipalId (object ID) for matching
- Case-insensitive matching for reliability
- Applications without matches receive zeroed statistics
- Verbose logging shows match success/failure for troubleshooting

Throttling Severity Thresholds:
The severity classification uses the following throttle rate thresholds:
- **0 (Normal)**: \< 1% throttle rate
- **1 (Minimal)**: 1-5% throttle rate
- **2 (Low)**: 5-10% throttle rate
- **3 (Warning)**: 10-25% throttle rate
- **4 (Critical)**: \>= 25% throttle rate

Progress Tracking:
- Progress bar displays during processing
- Shows application count and current operation
- Automatically completes when finished
- Use -Verbose for detailed match status

Logging Levels:
- **Write-PSFMessage -Level Debug -Message \<message\>**: Detailed per-app processing and matching logic
- **Write-PSFMessage -Level Verbose -Message \<message\>**: Match results, sample data, and lookup table size
- **Write-Progress**: Visual progress bar for user feedback
- **Standard Output**: Final application objects with ThrottlingStats

Error Handling:
- Individual query failures handled gracefully
- Applications without data receive zeroed statistics
- Processing continues even if some lookups fail
- Use -Verbose to see which apps couldn't be matched

Common Issues:

No throttling data for any applications:
- Verify Microsoft Graph logging is enabled in diagnostic settings
- Check Log Analytics workspace ID is correct
- Ensure applications have made API calls in the specified timeframe
- Verify diagnostic logs are flowing to workspace (check MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs table)
- Try increasing -Days parameter

Mismatched ServicePrincipalIds:
- Verify applications have valid PrincipalId property
- Check if ServicePrincipalIds in logs match app registrations
- Use -Verbose to see sample ServicePrincipalIds from both sources
- Ensure apps are making requests (not dormant)

Slow performance:
- Normal for very large tenants (5000+ apps)
- Single bulk query is already optimized
- Network latency to Log Analytics affects performance
- Consider running during off-peak hours

Memory issues:
- Bulk approach minimizes memory usage
- Lookup table is memory-efficient (hashtable)
- Should handle thousands of apps without issues
- Increase PowerShell memory limits if needed

Zero Values vs.
No Activity:
Both result in zeroed statistics, but interpretation differs:
- **No Activity**: App hasn't made any Graph API calls (expected for dormant apps)
- **Zero Throttling**: App is active but not being throttled (healthy state)
- Check TotalRequests to distinguish: 0 = no activity, \> 0 = active

Best Practices:
- Always use -Verbose for production monitoring
- Save results periodically for trend analysis (Export-Clixml)
- Monitor critical applications daily with automated alerting
- Review Warning/Critical severity apps weekly
- Archive monthly reports for compliance and capacity planning
- Combine with Get-AppActivityData for complete analysis
- Implement retry logic for apps with severity \>= 3

Mitigation Strategies for Throttled Applications:
- **Exponential Backoff**: Implement retry logic with exponential delays
- **Request Batching**: Use $batch endpoint to combine operations
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce calls
- **Delta Queries**: Use delta links for change tracking instead of full queries
- **Pagination**: Use proper pagination to avoid large result sets
- **Webhooks**: Replace polling patterns with event-driven webhooks
- **Rate Limit Headers**: Monitor Retry-After headers and throttle accordingly
- **Request Distribution**: Spread requests over time to avoid bursts
