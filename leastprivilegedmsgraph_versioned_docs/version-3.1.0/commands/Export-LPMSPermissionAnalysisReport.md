# Export-LPMSPermissionAnalysisReport

## SYNOPSIS
Generates an interactive HTML report for Microsoft Graph permission analysis results.

## SYNTAX

```
Export-LPMSPermissionAnalysisReport [-AppData] <Array> [[-OutputPath] <String>] [[-ReportTitle] <String>]
 [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This function creates a comprehensive, interactive HTML report that visualizes permission analysis
results for Microsoft Graph applications.
The report provides a user-friendly interface for reviewing
permission optimization opportunities, API activity patterns, and throttling statistics.

The generated report features:
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: User preference for viewing comfort
- **Interactive Data Tables**: Sortable and filterable tables for all data views
- **Permission Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges showing optimal, excess, and missing permissions
- **Throttling Statistics**: Visual severity indicators and detailed metrics
- **Detailed Modal Views**: Click any application for comprehensive details
- **CSV Export**: Export filtered data for further analysis
- **Search and Filter**: Real-time filtering across all applications
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Offline Capable**: Once generated, works without internet connection

Report Sections:
1.
**Summary Statistics**: Overview of total apps, permissions, and coverage
2.
**Applications Table**: Sortable list with key metrics per application
3.
**Application Details**: Click any row to see:
   - Current vs.
optimal permission comparison
   - API activity breakdown with method and endpoint details
   - Throttling statistics and health indicators
   - Permission recommendations

The function processes application analysis data (typically from Get-LPMSPermissionAnalysis),
embeds it as JSON into an HTML template with Tailwind CSS styling, and generates a
standalone HTML file that can be shared, archived, or viewed in any modern browser.

Use Cases:
- **Security Audits**: Document permission analysis for compliance requirements
- **Permission Right-Sizing**: Identify and communicate permission optimization opportunities
- **Change Management**: Create before/after reports for permission changes
- **Executive Reporting**: Visual, easy-to-understand permission health dashboard
- **Historical Tracking**: Archive reports over time to track permission hygiene trends

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
$results = Get-LPMSPermissionAnalysis -WorkspaceId $wsId -Days 30
$reportPath = Export-LPMSPermissionAnalysisReport -AppData $results -OutputPath ".\reports\monthly-analysis.html"
Start-Process $reportPath
```

Description:
Analyzes 30 days of activity, generates a report, and immediately opens it in the default browser.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
Get-LPMSPermissionAnalysis -WorkspaceId $wsId -Days 90 -ApplicationId $criticalApps |
    Export-LPMSPermissionAnalysisReport -OutputPath "C:\Reports\Critical_Apps_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').html" -ReportTitle "Critical Applications - Q4 Analysis"
```

Description:
Analyzes specific critical applications over 90 days, generates a timestamped report
with a custom title, saved to a dedicated reports folder.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
# Compare current vs. previous month
$thisMonth = Get-LPMSPermissionAnalysis -WorkspaceId $wsId -Days 30
$lastMonth = Get-LPMSPermissionAnalysis -WorkspaceId $wsId -Days 60 | Where-Object {
    $_.LastActivityDate -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)
}
```

Export-LPMSPermissionAnalysisReport -AppData $thisMonth -OutputPath ".\reports\current-month.html" -ReportTitle "Current Month"
Export-LPMSPermissionAnalysisReport -AppData $lastMonth -OutputPath ".\reports\last-month.html" -ReportTitle "Previous Month"

Description:
Generates two separate reports for comparison between time periods to identify
permission drift or changes in application behavior.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
# Filter and report on problematic applications only
$allResults = Get-LPMSPermissionAnalysis -WorkspaceId $wsId -Days 30
$problematic = $allResults | Where-Object {
    $_.ExcessPermissions.Count -gt 5 -or
    $_.RequiredPermissions.Count -gt 0 -or
    $_.ThrottlingStats.ThrottlingSeverity -ge 3
}
```

if ($problematic.Count -gt 0) {
    $report = Export-LPMSPermissionAnalysisReport -AppData $problematic -OutputPath ".\ActionRequired.html" -ReportTitle "Applications Requiring Attention"
    "Found $($problematic.Count) applications requiring attention.
Report: $report"
} else {
    "All applications are optimally configured!"
}

Description:
Filters analysis results to only applications with significant issues (excess permissions,
missing permissions, or throttling), generating a focused action-required report.

## INPUTS

## OUTPUTS

### System.String
### Returns the full absolute path to the generated HTML report file.
### This allows for easy chaining with other commands like Start-Process to open the report,
### or copy operations to move it to a shared location.
## NOTES
Prerequisites:
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Module must be properly installed with data\base.html template file
- Write permissions to the output directory

Template Architecture:
- The function uses a Jinja2-style template with placeholder blocks
- Template location: \<module-root\>\data\base.html
- Placeholders replaced:
  * {% block app_data %}{% endblock %} -\> JSON data
  * {% block title %}{% endblock %} -\> Report title
  * {% block generated_on %}{% endblock %} -\> Generation timestamp

JSON Processing:
- Application data converted to JSON with depth 10 (preserves nested structures)
- Special characters properly escaped for JavaScript embedding:
  * Backslashes: \ -\> \\\\
  * Quotes: " -\> \"
  * Newlines: \n -\> \\\\n
- Data is compressed (no indentation) to reduce file size

Report Size Considerations:
- Typical report: 500KB - 2MB depending on number of applications
- Large deployments (100+ apps): May reach 5-10MB
- Consider splitting very large tenants into multiple reports
- All data embedded in single HTML file (no external dependencies)

Browser Compatibility:
- Requires modern browser (released within last 2 years):
  * Chrome/Edge: Version 90+
  * Firefox: Version 88+
  * Safari: Version 14+
- JavaScript must be enabled
- Works fully offline once generated
- No server-side processing required

Security Considerations:
- Reports may contain sensitive information (app names, permission details)
- Store reports securely with appropriate access controls
- Consider encrypting archived reports
- Sanitize application names if sharing externally
- No credentials or secrets are included in reports

Performance:
- Report generation: ~1-2 seconds for 50 applications
- Browser rendering: ~2-5 seconds for 100 applications
- Search/filter: Real-time (\< 100ms for typical datasets)
- Large datasets (500+ apps) may cause slower browser performance

Troubleshooting:

If "Template file not found" error:
- Verify module is properly installed: Get-Module LeastPrivilegedMSGraph -ListAvailable
- Check module path: (Get-Module LeastPrivilegedMSGraph).ModuleBase
- Ensure data\base.html exists in module directory
- Reinstall module if template is missing

If report displays incorrectly:
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Try a different browser
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
- Verify the HTML file isn't corrupted (should be valid UTF-8)

If data appears truncated:
- Check that ConvertTo-Json depth (15) is sufficient for nested data
- Review input data structure for unexpected nesting
- Consider simplifying input data if depth exceeds 15 levels

Common Use Cases:
1.
**Monthly Security Reviews**: Generate reports for security team review
2.
**Audit Documentation**: Create compliance documentation for auditors
3.
**Change Requests**: Attach reports to permission change requests
4.
**Trend Analysis**: Archive monthly reports to track improvements
5.
**Stakeholder Communication**: Share visual reports with management
6.
**Incident Response**: Document permission state during investigations

Best Practices:
- Use consistent naming conventions for output files
- Include timestamps for historical tracking
- Store reports in version-controlled or backed-up locations
- Review reports regularly (weekly/monthly depending on environment)
- Act on recommendations within 30 days
- Archive reports for compliance (typically 1-7 years retention)
