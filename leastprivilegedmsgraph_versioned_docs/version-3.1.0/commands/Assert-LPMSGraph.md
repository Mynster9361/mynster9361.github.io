# Assert-LPMSGraph

## SYNOPSIS
Validates all prerequisites and requirements for using the LeastPrivilegedMSGraph module.

## SYNTAX

```
Assert-LPMSGraph [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Assert-LPMSGraph function performs a comprehensive validation of all prerequisites required
to successfully use the LeastPrivilegedMSGraph module.
It checks multiple components including:

- Entra Service Connectivity: Verifies authentication to required services (LogAnalytics, Graph, Azure)
- Azure AD Premium License: Confirms that Microsoft Entra ID P1 or higher license is available
- Diagnostic Settings: Validates that MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs diagnostic settings are configured
- Log Analytics Access: Tests workspace access and verifies MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs data availability
- Microsoft Graph API Permissions: Confirms sufficient permissions to read applications

The function returns a detailed result object containing the overall status, individual check results,
tenant ID, and timestamp.
Each check includes a name, status (Passed/Failed), descriptive message,
and any error details encountered.

This function is useful for troubleshooting setup issues and confirming that the environment is
properly configured before performing permission analysis operations.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Assert-LPMSGraph
```

Runs all prerequisite checks and returns a detailed validation report.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
$result = Assert-LPMSGraph
PS C:\> $result.Checks | Where-Object Status -eq 'Failed'
```

Stores the validation result and filters to show only failed checks.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
Assert-LPMSGraph | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Checks | Format-Table Name, Status, Message -AutoSize
```

Displays all validation checks in a formatted table showing name, status, and message.
