# Authenticating to Microsoft Graph API
H2
## First off we need to create the app registration in Azure/Entra

H3
### Now lets take what we just created and ask for a token

Bullet point
- Note if you do not have a certificate then you can generate a self signed certificate by following this article from Microsoft

Code block with syntax highlighting code language defined by name
```powershell
# Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret for the MS Graph API
$tenantId = "Your-tenant-id"
$clientId = "Your-client-id"
$thumbprint = "Your-Certificate-thumbprint"
```

    <tr>
      <td>scope</td>
      <td>Required</td>
      <td>The value passed for the scope parameter in this request should be the resource identifier (application ID URI) of the resource you want, suffixed with .default. All scopes included must be for a single resource. Including scopes for multiple resources will result in an error. For the Microsoft Graph example, the value is <code>https://graph.microsoft.com/.default</code>. This value tells the Microsoft identity platform that of all the direct application permissions you have configured for your app, the endpoint should issue a token for the ones associated with the resource you want to use. To learn more about the /.default scope, see the consent documentation.</td>
